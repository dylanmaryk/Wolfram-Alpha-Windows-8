Wolfram-Alpha-Windows-8
=======================

Due to reasons given by Wolfram Alpha's T&Cs, I am unable to be given a commerically usable allowance of API calls per month for distribution of this app on the Windows Store, hence I am making the code publiclly available.

This is a fully functional Windows 8 app which allows for searching and viewing data made available by Wolfram Alpha.

Improvements to be made (contributions very welcome):
- Snap view should be better suited to displaying the content at that window size
- Graphics should be added/improved
- It has been suggested most of the non-presentation code in SearchResults.xaml.cs could be put into a separate .cs file

How to set up for use:

Before running the app, you have to acquire your own app ID (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) and replace "INSERT-YOUR-ID-HERE" (not including quotes) (SearchResults.xaml.cs, line 43) with the app ID.
